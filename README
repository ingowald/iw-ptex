iw-ptex: ingowald's modified version of PTex
============================================

This project is a clone of the original Ptex Version 2.1.33, with
the (so far) following modifications/extension

- added functionality to 'parse' ptex 'files' from memory: If the
  filename passed to a PtexReader is of the form "mem://<%lx>/<%lx>",
  then the first of the <%lx>'s is (hex-formatted) 64-bit pointer, and
  the second one a (hex-formatted) 64-bit size. This allows for
  reading ptex from memory that somebody else has allocated (e.g.,
  form an ospray data array), as well as for using more than 1k ptex
  files concurrently (because we no longer open file descriptors)

- changed the PTexSeparableFilter to be thread save; i.e., a bilinear
  ptexturefilter can now be used from multiple threads in parallel

This project has been cloned from Disney's original Ptex 2.1.33
tarball, and that original project's license is thereby "inherited"
into this project. Any _additions_ done by me are hereby declared as
"free for all"; but if in doubt, check with the Disney lawyers....

> make doc

The Makefile uses cmake under the hood.

This will build, install to a local 'install' directory, and
run regression tests.

Contents of install directory:
install/bin:
ptxinfo

install/include:
PtexHalf.h  PtexInt.h  Ptexture.h  PtexUtils.h

install/lib:
libPtex.a  libPtex.so

Note: docs will be generated in the 'src/doc/ptex' directory
and installed as 'install/share/doc/ptex'.
